<h1>The Internet</h1>   
<p>The Internet, a revolutionary system architecture, has transformed mass communication, media, and commerce by connecting computer networks worldwide. Emerging in the United States during the 1970s, it became accessible to the public in the early 1990s. By 2020, over half of the world's population, approximately 4.5 billion people, had Internet access, with the number continuing to rise steadily.
    The Internet functions like an expansive spider web, linking computers worldwide instead of insects. Through various pathways such as cables, satellites, or wireless connections, each computer is interconnected, enabling data transmission across any physical distance. Users utilise the Internet as a platform to share diverse content, encompassing text, images, videos, music, and documents, akin to a boundless library open for contributions and access by all. Communication stands as a cornerstone of Internet usage, facilitated through mediums like emails, instant messaging, social media platforms, video calls, and VoIP services, enabling real-time interaction irrespective of geographical boundaries. Accessible from virtually any location with an Internet connection, users can engage in browsing, emailing, video streaming, and other online activities from home, work, or while travelling. The Internet serves as a global conduit, fostering connections, collaborations, and the exchange of ideas among individuals worldwide, transcending geographical and cultural barriers. Its pervasive influence has reshaped societal norms, revolutionising communication, commerce, education, and entertainment, ultimately transforming the fabric of human interaction and daily life on a global scale.

 <h2>How Does The Internet Work</h2>   
 <p>The Internet works through a complex system of interconnected networks. Here's a simplified breakdown:
Sending and Receiving Data: When you want to send or receive something (like visiting a website or sending an email), it's like borrowing or returning a book at the library.
<ul>
    <li><b>Routing:</b> Imagine each piece of information you send or receive is like a letter. Just like how a letter goes through different postal offices to reach its destination, your data travels through different pathways, like cables or satellites, to get where it needs to go.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li><b>Protocols:</b> These are like the rules of the library. They make sure that everyone follows the same system so that books (or data) can be organised and found easily.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li><b>Domain Name System (DNS):</b> This is like a library catalogue. When you type a website address, like "www.example.com," it's like looking up a book title in the catalogue to find out where it's located in the library.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li><b>Servers and Clients:</b> Servers are like the librarians who have all the books (or data) stored. When you ask for a website, your device (like a computer or phone) is like a person asking the librarian (the server) for a specific book (the website).
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Internet Service Providers (ISPs): They're like the roads that lead to the library. They provide the connection (like roads) that allows you to access the Internet from your home or wherever you are.</li>
<p>So, the Internet is basically a huge library where you can borrow and return all sorts of information, and everything works smoothly thanks to some simple rules and systems in place.

<h2>Difference between Internet and WWW.
</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web, commonly known as the web, is a collection of websites or web pages stored in web servers and linked to local computers via the internet. These websites include text pages, digital photos, audio, and videos, among other things.
    The difference between the Internet and WWW (World Wide Web ) is essential to understand.
    
    WWW or the web is one of the key services offered by the internet. The World Wide Web, or simply “web,” is the term for the collection of web pages that you view on your computer or other device using the “internet”. Simply put, the world wide web are the pages you see when you're at a device and you're online.
    
    On the other hand, the internet is the network of interconnected computers on which the web runs and the conduit through which emails and data pass. The internet has made many things feasible for humans, such as playing online games, electronic mail, internet calling, chatting, file sharing, etc
    
    To round it up, think of the internet as the roads that connect towns and cities together. The world wide web contains the things you see on the roads like houses and shops.
    
    And the vehicles are the data moving around - some go between websites and others will be transferring your emails or files across the internet, separately from the web.
